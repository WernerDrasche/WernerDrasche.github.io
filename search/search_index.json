The non-pc devices must be in the same local network as the server. Preparing the server Linux computer Download the source code from this thread or from here and then run make (on ubuntu server for the raspberry I didn't have to install any additional libraries but I think psql might be a requirement). Don't forget to make the server executable ( chmod +x server_name ). To start the server at boot install the following crontab ( crontab -e ): @reboot cd /absolute/path/to/server/directory && ./server_name After testing if it runs fine reboot the raspberry pi. Windows computer Unless you know how to compile stuff in windows (I certainly don't) you can just resort to opening up a game in PPSSPP on that computer everytime you want to play multiplayer. Make sure that the network >> enable pro adhoc server setting is checked. Preparing the Vita Follow this guide to install adrenaline. Adding an ISO is easy and involves just dragging it into the ux0:pspemu/ISO folder (in windows you have to check the \"show operating system folders\" setting). To exit adrenaline just long-press the home button, select settings and then close the emulation. Now we might want to figure out the Vita's IP address. The easiest way that I could find was to just enable the FTP server on Vita-Shell (press start and then change from USB to FTP mode). Now you can locate the device on your router and make the IP fixed which makes connecting with FTP easier in the future (just create a new site in WinScp for example). The next step is the installation of the plugin that will allow adrenaline to connect to the adhoc server. It is called \"Pro online\" and there is apparently a version created specifically for adrenaline. You can get it on reddit or here in case the link is dead. Extract the contents into ux0:pspemu and prepare the following files: game.txt : ms0:/seplugins/atpro.prx 1 hotspot.txt : {name of wifi network (without the curly braces of course)} server.txt : {local ip address of spare computer (you should also make sure that it's fixed as well)} Now go back to adrenaline and open the network settings. There you select infrastructure mode then scan and connect to your network. To finish the plugin installation press select and enable recovery menu >> advanced >> force high memory layout . Go back and on your way you should check that recovery menu >> plugins >> atpro.prx is indeed enabled. Get PPSSPP for the Switch Use this thread to get a recent release. Change the following settings: network >> pro adhoc address : {server local IP-address} network >> wifi channel : 1 network >> port offset : 0 If the fonts look bad ingame you can get original fonts here . Extract them into /switch/ppsspp/assets/flash0/font . If there is no improvement try to change the game resolution (x times PSP) and restart the game (maybe some stuff is cached). Done Everything should work now. You could probably add the server to a zerotier network so that you could play with computers outside of the local network (I did not test this). It took me a lot of hours to get this to work so maybe this can be helpful to someone.
